 Purpose: Write a program that simulates a lottery. The program should have an 
          array of five integers named lottery and should generate a random 
          number in the range of 0 through 9 for each element in the array. The 
          user should enter five digits, which should be stored in an integer 
          array named user. The program is to compare the correspond- ing 
          elements in the two arrays and keep a count of the digits that match.
