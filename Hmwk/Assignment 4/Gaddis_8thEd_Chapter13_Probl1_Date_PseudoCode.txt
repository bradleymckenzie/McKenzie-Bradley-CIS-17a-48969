/* 
 * File:   main.cpp
 * Author: Bradley McKenzie
 * Created on October 16, 2017
 * Purpose: Date: Design a class called Date. The class should store a date in
 * three integers: month, day, and year. There should be member functions to
 * print the date in the following forms:
 *                                        12/25/2014
 *                                        December 25, 2014
 *                                        25 December 2014
 * Demonstrate the class by writing a complete program implementing it.
